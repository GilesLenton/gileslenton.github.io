Insight & Strategy was founded by Giles Lenton in 2002 after 22 years as a qualitative researcher, research company owner and manager.

Giles started Insight + Strategy to meet the needs of his clients who wanted him to be more involved in the use of insights as well as the generation of insights.

A Sociology graduate from the London School of Economics, Giles Lenton started his first research company- Diagnostics - in 1985. He lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and two children. In the winter months he is a Rugby Referee for the London Society of Rugby Football Union Referees and in the summer months he is a frustrated fly-fisherman.

Giles works in the Financial Services sector for The Wisdom Council, where he is their resident insight and strategy expert.
